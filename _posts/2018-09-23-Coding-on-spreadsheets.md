    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I had to persevere as at first my spreadsheet was not working. I carried on trying and eventually I succeeded in getting the work right.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned my partner on how to do the work as he had completed it before me. This helped me finish the work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I had to be independent when I was doing the work for periods of time as this helped me do the work more effectively in some places.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I had to reflect on what Mr Keen had told us at the start of the lesson so I could remember what to do for the work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged in the discussion by putting forward points on the work.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have tried to retain the information better from the start of the lesson when we were told what to do for our work as it took me a while to get it right. In the end I managed to succeed as I persevered but this wouldn't have had to happen if I had just listened better in the first place.

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I could try to do the work quicker and more effectively as then I could go onto other things and learn more about the subject we are doing. This would improve my learning as I would learn more and expand my knowledge on the subject. I could work more quickly and efficiently by listening better, contributing more and asking others.</td>
