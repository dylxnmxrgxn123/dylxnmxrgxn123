    <td>When we came to class we were told to sit down and log on. Mr Keen then made us all delete our old Github repositories and start again.  We then had to remember what we did last year so we could create the website. First we used config.yml to put our name description and avatar onto the website. Sadly Github was being quite slow so it did not transfer onto my website. Instead I just saw error 404 on the screen. This didn't stop me though as I started on style.css so when it did go on I would be further ahead than I would be if I just waited. I started by trying to add a background from an image online but it was showing an error in the settings. So to overcome this I went onto W3Schools and found out the right way to do it. By the time I had got it right Mr Keen called us all in for a talk about what we should do if we aren't sure about if our code is correct. He recommended using JS Bin and Mozilla Thimble. He went onto Mozilla Thimble and showed us an example of how we would check to see if the code was correct. He also used W3Schools to help him. By then it was the end of the lesson.</td>

    <td>What strategies were effective?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>An effective strategy was to use W3Schools as it supplied me with the information I needed to make my website better. It was effective as it did not take me long to find the correct information and it was helpful. Another effective strategy is to look back at older classroom pages as they have information about the blogs that i had forgotten and it helped me make my blog better.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will use JS Bin and Mozilla Thimble as I have seen how effective they are and it will help make my blog better and make me quicker at doing the blog so I  have more time to add stuff to my blog and improve it. This will improve my learning as I will get more work done and it will deepen my understanding on this topic. </td>
